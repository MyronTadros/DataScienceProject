# DATA SCIENCE PROJECT Studying Factors affecting academic Performance 

Studying the factors influencing students’ academic performance has been tackled numerous times in previous literature utilizing Educational Data Mining. While previous studies mentioned factors like guardian education/occupation and socioeconomic status, athleticism, and gender have not been documented enough. This paper uses a publicly available dataset and applies several regression and classification models to it to further understand the correlation between factors like previous SAT scores, gender, and athleticism and the ability to predict a student’s GPA and success in applying for a master’s degree. The paper found that all features apart from gender had a significant impact on the GPA of the students. Moreover, the classification model proved to be highly effective in predicting poor academic performance, while struggling to accurately predict success.

the code runs on Python environments 3.12.3/3.10.6/3.10.11 --> indicating generalibility in where the code can run 

Make sure to run the pip isntall commands in the first code block if the import packages block fails
